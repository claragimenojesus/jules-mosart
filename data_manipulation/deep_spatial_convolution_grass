# Worflow:

# 1. set up vilcanota DEM, generate flow accumulation map
# 2. generate a drainage network of the major rivers by choosing a threshold of the accumulated area (essentially, if (accumulated area > 0) then pixel is a major river. This needs a bit of trial and error, and at what elevation and river size we think groundwater is resurfacing
# 3. then use a flow tracing algorithm to determine the flow distance between all gridcells and the closest downstream "major river" cell downstream.
# 4. Make histogram of the obtained distances.
# 5. Convolute deep recharge contribution to the transect through the distance histogram to "shift" it downstream
                                                                                                      
                                                                                                      
# in GRASS:
#1. Reproject DEM and related raster layers into projected coordinate system with units in meters (otherwise the r.stream.distance script will not work

# Export original DEM from GRASS to GeoTIFF
r.out.gdal input=dem_filled output=/path/to/dem_filled.tif format=GTiff --overwrite

# Reproject DEM to UTM Zone 19S (EPSG:32719) using GDAL
gdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:32719 /path/to/dem_filled.tif /path/to/dem_filled_utm.tif

# Create a new GRASS Location using the UTM-reprojected DEM
grass -c /path/to/dem_filled_utm.tif /path/to/new_location_utm

# Import the UTM DEM into GRASS
r.in.gdal input=/path/to/dem_filled_utm.tif output=dem_filled_utm

# Set GRASS region to match DEM
g.region raster=dem_filled_utm

# 2. Set computation region to UTM DEM

g.region raster=dem_filled_utm -p

# 3. Calculate depresionless DEM, flow direction with D8 format, flow accumulation and stream network for different thresholds (implemented for thres=200,500,1000, 10000,20000)
# this needs to be iterated, depending on what stream network we think is more appropriate. We eneded up going with 20,000 which gave us a mean distance to main river stream of 10km
r.watershed -s elevation=dem_filled_utm threshold=1000 drainage=flow_dir accumulation=flow_accum stream=stream_1000 â€“-overwrite

# 5. Calculate distance to river - Output raster in meters

r.stream.distance stream_rast=stream_1000 direction=flow_dir distance=dist_to_river_1000 --overwrite

 # then process results in python!
