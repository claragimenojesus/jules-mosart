Problem 1: Compilation issues
Solution 1: However, you will need to set the following variable in site/suite.rc.CHAUKHAMBA:
export JULES_FFLAGS_EXTRA="-fallow-argument-mismatch"
and then in ~/MODELS/jules-vn6.1/etc/fcm-make/compiler/gfortran.cfg you will need to change the following line:
$fflags_normal  = $fflags_common -Werror
into:
$fflags_normal  = $fflags_common #-Werror
(or simply remove "-Werror")

Hi Clara - the spinup is controlled via the rose-app.conf and suite.rc files. You can control the spinup length via the variables SPINCYCLES and SPINLEN in rose-app.conf. You should leave the spinup section as it was before in the app/jules/rose-app.conf file.
